Description:
    Initial commit of working prototype for extracting member forces. Program can parse .gto file and search for
    instances of 'LIST FOR' and return a csv file of results based on inputs from the user. This includes, specific
    beams, loads, and joints as well as which instance of 'LIST FOR' is requested.

Description:

    This version mainly focused on addressing error handling for the GUI and Member Force Extraction portion of the
    program. Functionality was added as described below.

    Functionality Changes:

        Added ability to store generated result sets in a 'properties' file and added the ability to read from the file
        and restore generated results.
        Added ability to delete multiple selected member results sets at once
        Added checks to insure a directory and file are selected
        Added 'safety' by changing which buttons are enabled or disabled at a given time, preventing unexpected user
        inputs.
        Changed from manipulating array with numpy concatenate to using lists and list comprehension. Run time is now
        an O(n) operation instead of O(n^2). Yay!
        Added error window and warning popups for invalid inputs into the 'store member forces' window
        Changed save to excel option to write contents to rows and columns rather than just rows. This results in each
        piece of data going into its own cell - results in not having to do text to columns manually.
        When result is modified, the previous results are repopulated in the 'new member results' window


    Interface Changes:

        Added button to store created results sets
        modified button size on member force extraction page to be consistent
        Added error popups for several error types
        Removed output format frame and radio buttons. User is now allowed to save file using Windows file dialog
